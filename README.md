# FeedStats

FeedStats is an android app to see the subscriber stats of a feed. 

I created this app to demonstrate the ability to [draw graphs in Android](http://sudarmuthu.com/blog/generating-graphs-in-android) by using jQuery and flot JavaScript libraries and embedding them in a webview control

## Installing

The app is available in Android market as a free app. You can download and install the app from the market by searching for FeedStats and using the [direct link](https://market.android.com/details?id=com.sudarmuthu.android.feedstats).
